# kenya-wards-constituencies-county-rest-api
This is a REST API allowing users to get information about different wards from all over Kenya

Here is the API's documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/4315414/Rzn8NgRo

In the project, I use Node.js, MongoDB and Express. The app is uploaded to heroku and its URL is https://frozen-basin-45055.herokuapp.com/api/wards?county=Nairobi.
